# How to Create a New Repository and Upload the code to GitHub

#1. Create a new repository on GitHub by clicking on New repository

#2. Give the repository a name, set it to `Public`, and check `Initialize this repository with a README`.

#3. Your new repository has been created and it looks like this. Now click on `Clone or download`  and copy the link associated with your new repository from GitHub.

#4. Open the Bash (or Terminal) window.

#5. Using Console, navigate into a folder where you’d like to download your code. In this case, I’m navigating into a folder called RutgersDataBootcamp in my c: Drive. In your case, it can be anywhere on your computer where you want to download code.

#6. In console, type the command `git clone ` and paste the link to your GitHub repository in that blank space. Your screen should look something like this. If the URL that you copied in Step 3 is `https://github.com/ruchichandra/DemoRepository.git`, the command here would be `git clone https://github.com/ruchichandra/DemoRepository.git`.

#7. If you navigate to that folder using file explorer / finder, you will see a new folder with the same name as your repository has been downloaded.

#8. Go into that folder and you will see that it currently has a README file. This folder is now linked to Git.

#9. Create a new Python file (or use an old one). Save that file inside your local repository folder.

#10. In console, navigate into the folder associated with your code using the cd command.

#11. Next, type the command git add –A. This will tell git to notice the addition of the new Python file. If this command runs successfully, you shouldn’t see anything happen.

#12. Type the command `git commit –m “_____”` and place a meaningful comment in the quotes. This will save your changes locally. For example, if adding a blank Python file, you might type, `git commit -m "initialize python file"`. Note that the message *must* be enclosed in quotation marks.

#13. Type the final command, `git push origin master`. Enter your GitHub username and password if asked.

#14. Go back to the GitHub repository, and you should see that your file has been uploaded.

#15. **Success!!**
